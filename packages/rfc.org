* RFC Mode
  Who doesn't like RFCs? This should let me easily browse and read
  them.

  I'll explicitly set the rfc repo directory, just as a reference.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package rfc-mode
      :ensure t
      :init (setq rfc-mode-directory (expand-file-name "~/rfc/")))
  #+END_SRC
