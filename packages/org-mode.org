#+TITLE: Org Mode Configuration

* Attention!
  Don't forget, this project is using a local git submodule that
  clones the git repo for org-mode. It's installed locally, so we
  don't need to deal with =use-package= or whatever to install it.

* Color & Display
  Org can be made /more pretty/.

** Bullets
   These look oh-so-much better.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package org-bullets
	:ensure t
	:init (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-bullets-mode))
   #+END_SRC

** Font Coloring
   Make sure we fontify the native code blocks. It should default to
   true, but just in case.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
     (setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
   #+END_SRC
