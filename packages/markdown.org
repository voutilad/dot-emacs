* A necessary Evil
  Can you tell I have a slightly more *hate* than love relationship
  with Markdown? Seems Emacs agrees because it still doesn't do
  anything for it out of the box!

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package markdown-mode
      :ensure t
      :mode ("\\.\\(m\\(ark\\)?down\\|md\\)$" . markdown-mode))
  #+END_SRC
